Based on the header file and project structure, here's a comprehensive set of test cases to verify the shell's functionality and parsing capabilities:


### 1. Basic Command Execution
```shell script
ls
pwd
echo hello
/bin/ls
./nonexistent_command    # Should handle errors
```
//todo: gives>
bash-5.2$ ./nonexistent_command
bash: ./nonexistent_command: No such file or directory
vs
minishell > ./nonexistent_command
minishell: ./nonexistent_command: command not found
minishell >


TEST:
echo \
gives new line input

- cat | cat | ls


### 2. Arguments and Options
```shell script
ls -la
echo -n hello
echo "hello   world"     # Multiple spaces
echo 'hello   world'     # Multiple spaces in single quotes
```

//TODO Vars not handled
### 3. Environment Variables
```shell script
echo $PATH
echo "$PATH"
echo '$PATH'            # Should print literal $PATH
echo $NONEXISTENT      # Should print nothing
echo $PWD$HOME         # Concatenated variables
echo $?                # Last exit status
```


### 4. Quotes Handling
```shell script
echo "hello 'world'"
echo 'hello "world"'
echo "hello \"world\""  # Escaped quotes
echo 'it'\''s'         # Escaped single quote
echo "hello $USER"     # Variable expansion in double quotes
echo 'hello $USER'     # No variable expansion in single quotes
```


### 5. Redirections
```shell script
echo hello > output.txt
cat < input.txt
echo hello >> output.txt
cat << EOF             # Heredoc
ls > file1 2> file2   # Stdout and stderr redirection
```


### 6. Pipes
```shell script
ls | grep "a"
cat file.txt | grep "pattern" | wc -l
ls | sort | uniq
echo hello | cat -e
```


### 7. Built-in Commands
```shell script
cd ..
cd ~
cd /path/to/dir
pwd
echo hello
export TEST=value
env | grep TEST
unset TEST
exit 42
```


### 8. Complex Cases
```shell script
echo hello > f1 | cat < f2    # Pipe with redirections
cat << EOF | grep "pattern"   # Heredoc with pipe
ls > file1 2>&1              # Redirect stderr to stdout
echo $HOME"test"'$USER'      # Mixed quotes and variables
```


### 9. Error Cases
```shell script
|                    # Syntax error: single pipe
ls |                # Syntax error: nothing after pipe
> output.txt        # Syntax error: no command
<                   # Syntax error: no file
"unclosed quote     # Syntax error: unclosed quote
'unclosed quote     # Syntax error: unclosed quote
ls >>> file         # Syntax error: invalid operator
```


### 10. Signal Handling
```shell script
cat                 # Then press Ctrl+C
./infinite_loop     # Then press Ctrl+C
cat << EOF          # Then press Ctrl+C during heredoc
cat                 # Then press Ctrl+D
```


### 11. Special Characters
```shell script
echo ~              # Home directory expansion
echo \$PATH         # Escaped special character //todo echo The \# here does not begin a comment.
echo \\            # Backslash
echo \|            # Escaped pipe
```


### 12. Multiple Commands
```shell script
echo hello; ls      # Not required but good to test
cd .. && ls        # Not required but good to test
```


### Environment Variable Edge Cases
```shell script
export ""          # Empty string
export a=
export a="b"=c     # Multiple equal signs
export 123=456     # Invalid variable name
```


To properly test these cases:
1. Create a test script that runs each command and verifies the output
2. Compare outputs with bash
3. Check exit status ($?) after each command
4. Verify memory leaks using Valgrind
5. Test signal handling in various scenarios
6. Verify proper cleanup of file descriptors
7. Check environment variable modifications persist correctly

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these test cases or
provide specific expected outputs for any of them?

Comments. Lines beginning with a # (with the exception of #!) are comments and will not be executed.

# This line is a comment.

Comments may also occur following the end of a command.

echo "A comment will follow." # Comment here.
#                            ^ Note whitespace before #

Comments may also follow whitespace at the beginning of a line.

     # A tab precedes this comment.

Comments may even be embedded within a pipe.

initial=( `cat "$startfile" | sed -e '/#/d' | tr -d '\n' |\
# Delete lines containing '#' comment character.
           sed -e 's/\./\. /g' -e 's/_/_ /g'` )
# Excerpted from life.sh script

The final special character you will need to handle is the pipe ("|"). The idea of a pipe is that one can specify a series of commands, such that the output of the first command is sent as input to the second command, the output of the second to the third, and so on. For example, one might list a directory, search for all file names that include the letter "d" using grep, and then count them using the word count (wc) utility:

ls | grep "d" | wc -l

The shell actually creates three child processes and connects their input and output handles appropriately. For now, your job is simply to parse this pattern correctly; you will implement pipes in Lab 2.

Specifically, the output of parse_line is a two-dimensional array of commands and tokens. A line of input should render one top-level, or command, entry for each step in a "pipeline" as above. For instance, in the example above, if the returned structure is named commands, it should look like:

commands[0] = ["ls", '\0']
commands[1] = ["grep", "\"d\"", '\0']
commands[2] = ["wc", "-l", '\0']
commands[3] = ['\0']

Note: When file redirection and pipelines are combined, you can assume that only the first stage will have input redirection, and only the last stage will have output redirection. For example:

grep "d" < in.txt | grep -v "html" | wc -l > out.txt

The semantics of input file redirection after the first stage, or output before the final stage are not defined and will not be tested. For example, you need not handle cases like:

ls | grep -v "html" > foo.txt | wc -l
grep "d" < in.txt | grep -v "html" < a.txt | wc -l


Possible combinations

You can combine these with file descriptors or use them multiple times, for example:

    Redirect standard error

command 2>> errors.log

appends stderr to errors.log.

Combine multiple redirects

command >> out.log 2>> errors.log

appends stdout and stderr to different files.

Here-document with a specific file descriptor

cat <<EOF 1>>out.log
text
EOF

uses a here-document to cat, but appends catâ€™s output to out.log.

Here-strings with <<<
(a variant of <<, note the triple less-than)

    cat <<< "single line of input"

    passes a single string directly to stdin.

Summary table:
Operator	Meaning
<<	here-document (multi-line stdin)
<<<	here-string (single-line stdin)
>>	append stdout to file
n>>file	append file descriptor n to file
n<<word	here-document for file descriptor n
